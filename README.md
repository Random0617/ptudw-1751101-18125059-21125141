# Additional notes not covered in videos:
* Part 1 is project description, there are no additional notes.
* Part 2 is template description, there are no additional notes.
* Part 3 is the first part that you have to code. To be able to run the code in the video, you additionally have to do the following that is not covered in the video:
  * Type `npm install -g nodemon` in terminal of your project folder (assuming you use Visual Studio Code) to install required stuff to use `nodemon` in the video.
  * Type `npm install -g pnpm` in the project terminal in VS Code.
  * Do what [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63424744) says: run Windows Powershell as administrator, enter `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`, then choose "Yes to All".
  * `process.env.PORT` doesn't work, so we set port to a constant 5000 for now.
